1. When you access a subscript on an optional value through optional chaining, you place the question mark before the subscriptâ€™s brackets, not after. The optional chaining question mark always follows immediately after the part of the expression that is optional.

        if let firstRoomName = john.residence?[0].name {
            print("The first room name is \(firstRoomName).")
        } else {
            print("Unable to retrieve the first room name.")
        }
        // Prints "Unable to retrieve the first room name."
